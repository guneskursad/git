==========

1- local repository:

  1.1- working area
    - git doesnt know what to do, just knows these files contain some updates

  1.2- staging area
    - contains new changes that will soon be committed

  1.3- committed files

2- remote repository:
 - is usually a centralized server (optional)
 - is useful when you want to backup of your data
